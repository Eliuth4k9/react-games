### React-Game

# Description

This is a fun roguelike game that lets the players adventure through a canvas like box usinf npm riot-js to build the world. You can pickup items along your adventure and encounter monsters as well (careful out there). I coded this app following and learning from a tutorial from Morgan Page. Morgan Page has many classes available on SkillShare. Please checkout his videos and show him some support.
